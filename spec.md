## Vector

A point or size in two dimensional space.

### x: Number

Position or size on the horizontal x axis.

### y: Number

Position or size on the vertical y axis.

## Bounds

A bounding box defined by minimum (top left) and maximum (bottom right) points.

### min: Vector

The top left position.

### max: Vector

The bottom left position.

## Inset

### left: Number

### right: Number

### top: Number

### bottom: Number

## View

A basic user interface element. A rectangle that can be positioned within other views.

### id: String

An non-unique identifier used to query views from a layout.

### anchor: Bounds or Enum

Views are laid out relative to their anchor. Anchors are normalized bounds mapped to the viewâ€™s parent. Anchors can also be defined in shorthand. (Maybe this can be inferred automatically?)

* top-left
* vertical-top
* top-right
* horizontal-left
* center
* horizontal-right
* bottom-left
* vertical-bottom
* bottom-right
* top-stretch
* horizontal-stretch
* bottom-stretch
* left-stretch
* vertical-stretch
* right-stretch
* stretch

### x: Number

Horizontal position relative to the anchor. Ignored if the horizontal anchor axis is stretched.

### y: Number

Vertical position relative to the anchor. Ignored if the vertical anchor axis is stretched.

### left: Number

Used to position views anchored to the left of their parent.

### right: Number

Used to position views anchors to the right of their parent.

### top: Number

Used to position views anchored to the top of their parent.

### bottom: Number

Used to position views anchored to the bottom of their parent.

### width: Number

The view's horizontal size. Ignored if the horizontal anchor axis is stretched.

### height: Number

The view's vertical size: Ignored if the horizontal anchor axis is stretched.

### layout: Layout

Auto layout rules for parents and children.

## Layout

Configures layout rules.

### min-width: Number

### max-width: Number

### preferred-width: Number

### preferred-height: Number

### horizontal-portion: Number

### vertical-portion: Number

### type: Enum

Parent layout type.

* vertical
* horizontal
* grid

### horizontal-fit: Enum

* minimum
* preferred

### vertical-fit: Enum

* minimum
* preferred

### padding: Inset

Adds padding around childen in a layout.

### spacing: Number or Vector

Defines the space between children. Grid layouts can use a Vector instead of a Number for different horizontal and vertical spacing.

### ignore: Bool

Ignore layout rules.
